    fields:
      name: fields
      description: |
        Comma separated list of field references to include in the result.

        Each field reference is a field name, or a sequence of field names separated by slashes. For
        example, to get the `name` field and the `country` subfield of the `extensions` field:

        ```
        fields=name,extensions/country
        ```

        When this parameter isn't used all the fields will be returned.
      in: query
      required: false
      schema:
        type: string
      example: "name,extensions/country"

    excludeFields:
      name: exclude_fields
      description: |
        Comma separated list of field references to exclude from the result.

        Each field reference is a field name, or a sequence of field names separated by slashes. For
        example, to exclude the `country` subfield of the `extensions` field:

        ```
        exclude_fields=extensions/country
        ```

        When this parameter isn't used no field will be excluded.

        Fields in this list will be excluded even if they are explicitly included using the
        `fields` parameter.

    filter:
      name: filter
      description: |
        Search criteria.

        Contains one or more search criteria, separated by semicolons. Each search criteria is a
        tuple containing an operator, a field reference and one or more values. The operator can
        be any of the following strings:

        | Operator | Meaning                                                     |
        |----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `cont`   | Matches if the field contains the value                     |
        | `eq`     | Matches if the field is equal to the value                  |
        | `gt`     | Matches if the field is greater than the value              |
        | `gte`    | Matches if the field is greater than or equal to the value  |
        | `in`     | Matches if the field is one of the values                   |
        | `lt`     | Matches if the field is less than the value                 |
        | `lte`    | Matches if the field is less than or equal to the the value |
        | `ncont`  | Matches if the field does not contain the value             |
        | `neq`    | Matches if the field is not equal to the value              |
        | `nin`    | Matches if the field is not one of the values               |

        The field reference is the name of one of the fields of the object, or a sequence of
        name of fields separated by slashes. For example, to use the `country` sub-field inside
        the `extensions` field:

        ```
        filter=(eq,extensions/country,EQ)
        ```

        The values are the arguments of the operator. For example, the `eq` operator compares
        checks if the value of the field is equal to the value.

        The `in` and `nin` operators support multiple values. For example, to check if the `country`
        sub-field inside the `extensions` field is either `ES` or `US:

        ```
        filter=(in,extensions/country,ES,US)
        ```

        When values contain commas, slashes or spaces they need to be surrounded by single quotes.
        For example, to check if the `name` field is the string `my cluster`:

        ```
        filter=(eq,name,'my cluster')
        ```

        When multiple criteria separated by semicolons are used, all of them must match for the
        complete condition to match. For example, the following will check if the `name` is
        `my cluster` *and* the `country` extension is `ES`:

        ```
        filter=(eq,name,'my cluster');(eq,extensions/country,ES)
        ```

        When this parameter isn't used all the results will be returned.
