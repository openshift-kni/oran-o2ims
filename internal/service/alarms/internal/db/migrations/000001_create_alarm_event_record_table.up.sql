/*
Manages alarm lifecycle of alarm events.

The trigger manage_alarm_event is called BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE to manage:
- alarm_changed_time: Tracks when alarm state or attributes last changed
- notification_event_type: Indicates type of change (CLEAR/ACKNOWLEDGE/CHANGE)
- alarm_sequence_number: Increments on state changes or updates

For new alarms (INSERT):
- Sets alarm_changed_time to alarm_raised_time
- Sets CLEAR notification if initially resolved and alarm_changed_time to alarm_cleared_time
- Uses auto-incremented alarm_sequence_number

State transition priority (UPDATE):
1. Alarm State Change (NEW) - When status becomes 'firing' (from 'resolved')
2. Alarm State Change (CLEAR) - When status becomes 'resolved' (from 'new')
3. Acknowledgment (ACKNOWLEDGE) - On first acknowledgment
4. Attribute Changes (CHANGE) - For unacknowledged alarms only

alarm_sequence_number incremented when any of these changes occur:
- Alarms status moves from resolved to firing
- Alarm status changes firing to resolved
- First acknowledgment
- Changes to key attributes (if not acknowledged)

alarm_changed_time updates:
- On change to resolved status from non-resolved, with alarm_cleared_time
- On changes to key attributes, with current time (if not acknowledged)
- On first time acknowledged, with alarm_acknowledged_time
