All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.28.1] - 2024-06-28

### Fixed

- Also add the enum to the type array if an array of the enum is added. This is to prvent issues if the enum is only used in an array.
- Handle null column names in expression indexes. (thanks @mbezhanov)

## [v0.28.0] - 2024-06-25

### Added

- Added the `pgtypes.Inet` for `inet` type in PostgreSQL. (thanks @gstarikov)
- Added the `pgtypes.Macaddr` for `macaddr` and `macaddr8` types in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.LSN` type for the `pg_lsn` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.TxIDSnapshot` type for the `txid_snapshot` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added the `pgtypes.TSVector` type for the `tsvector` type in PostgreSQL.
- Added `AliasOf` property to codegen type definitions to allow for defining types that have their own randomization logic.
- Added `DependsOn` property to codegen type definitions to allow for defining types that depend on other types. This ensures that necessary code for the dependent types is generated.
- Add `xml` type definition for custom randomization logic.
- Add the `Cast()` starter to all dialects to build `CAST(expr AS type)` expressions.
- Load index information for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite tables. (thanks @mbezhanov)

### Changed

- Changed the `parray` package to `pgtypes`.
- Moved `HStore` to the `pgtypes` package.
- Simplified how random expressions are written for types by using standalone functions instead of a single generic function.
- The default `DebugPrinter` now prints args a bit more nicely by using thier `Value()` method if they implement the `driver.Valuer` interface.
- Only generate 2 random values when testing random expressions.

### Removed

- Removed `types.Stringer[T]`. It makes assumptions for how the type should be scanned and is not reliable.

### Fixed

- Do not add `FROM` clause to `SELECT` queries that are used as subqueries.
- Enum values are now checked for validity after scanning.

## [v0.27.1] - 2024-06-05

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `Count()` queries not removing the offset from the original query. (thanks @daddz)

## [v0.27.0] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Add PreloadAs PreloadOption to override the join alias when preloading a relationship with a left join. (thanks @daddz)
- Add `AliasedAs()` method to `tableColumns` and `tableWhere` types to use a custom alias.
- Add `AliasedAs()` method to generated relationship join mods. This is avaible in two places:

  - one to change the alias of the table being queried

    ```go
    models.SelectJoins.Jets.AliasedAs("j").InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx)
    ```

  - and the other to change the alias of the relationship.

    ```go
    models.SelectJoins.Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx).AliasedAs("p")
    ```

- Add `fm` mods to all supported dialects (psql, mysql and sqlite). These are mods for functions and are used to modify the function call. For example:

  ```go
  // import "github.com/stephenafamo/bob/dialect/psql/fm"
  psql.F( "count", "*",)(fm.Filter(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done"))))
  ```

- Add `MustCreate`, `MustCreateMany`, `CreateOrFail` and `CreateManyOrFail` methods to generated factory Templates

### Changed

- Change the function call point for generated relationship join mods. This reduces the amount of allocations and only does the work for the relationship being used.

  ```go
  // Before
  models.SelectJoins(ctx).Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots
  // After
  models.SelectJoins.Jets.InnerJoin.Pilots(ctx)
  ```

- Changed the `Count()` function on `Views` to clone the query instead of changing the existing one. This makes queries reusable and the `Count()` function to behave as one would expect.

  ```go
  // This now works as expected
  query := models.Jets.Query(ctx, db, /** list of various mods **/)
  count, err := query.Count()
  items, err := query.All()
  ```

- Changed how functions are modified. Instead of chained methods, the `F()` starter now returns a function which can be called with mods:

  ```go
  // Before
  psql.F( "count", "*",).FilterWhere(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done"))),
  // After
  // import "github.com/stephenafamo/bob/dialect/psql/fm"
  psql.F( "count", "*",)(fm.Filter(psql.Quote("status").EQ(psql.S("done")))),
  ```

  This makes it possible to support more queries.

- Use `netip.Addr` instead of `netip.Prefix` for Postgres `cidr` type.
- Use `decimal.Decimal` instead of `string` for Postgres `money` type.
- Use `net.HardwareAddr` for Postgres `macaddr8` type, in addition to the `macaddr` type.
- Code generation now generates struct tags for the generated model Setters as well, if configured through the `Tags` configuration option. Previoulsy, only the model struct fields were tagged. (thanks @singhsays)

### Removed

- Remove `TableWhere` function from the generated code. It was not used by the rest of the generated code and offered no clear benefit.
- Removed `As` starter. It takes an `Expression` and is not needed since the `Expression` has an `As` method which can be used directly.

### Fixed

- Fix a bug with `types.Stringer[T]` where the wrong value was returned in the `Value()` method.

## [v0.26.1] - 2024-05-26

### Fixed

- Use `netip.Prefix` instead of `netip.Addr` for postgres inet column type. This makes it possible to contain a subnet.
- Allow underscores in enum variable names.
- Fix an issue with title casing enum values

## [v0.26.0] - 2024-05-21

### Added

- Add `bobgen-sql` a code generation driver for SQL schema files. Supports PostgreSQL and SQLite.
- Add new properties `compare_expr` and `compare_expr_imports` to the `types` configuration. This is used when comparing primary keys and in testing.
- Add `never_required` to relationships configuration. This makes sure the factories does not require the relationship to be set. Useful if you're not using foreign keys. (thanks @jacobmolby)
- Add wrapper types for Stringer, TextMarshaler/Unmarshaler, and BinaryMarshaler/Unmarshaler to the `types` configuration.
- Make generated enum types implement the `fmt.Stringer`, `encoding.TextMarshaler`, `encoding.TextUnmarshaler`, `encoding.BinaryMarshaler` and `encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler` interfaces.

### Fixed

- Properly detect reference columns for implicit foreign keys in SQLite.
- Fix panic when generating random values for nullable columns. (thanks @jacobmolby)
- Sort relationships and imports for deterministic generated code. (thanks @jacobmolby)
- Correctly allow `OVER ()` with an empty window definition in PostgreSQL. (thanks @relvacode)
- Set `GROUP BY` to `NULL` if there are no expressions to group by.
- Replace symbols in enum values with their unicode point to make them valid Go identifiers.
- Properly detect implicit foreign keys in SQLite.
- Fix issue with attaching multi-sided relationships. (thanks @jacobmolby)

## [v0.23.0] - 2024-01-03

### Added

- Add `bob.Cache()` which saves the built SQL and args to prevent rebuilding the same query multiple times.
- Add `As()` starter to alias expressions
- Add `OP()` builder method for using custom operators

- It is now possible to configure additional constraints for code generation.
- Add `um.SetCol()` which maintains the old behavior of `um.Set()`.
- Generate additional `Expressions()` method for Setters to make it easier to use them in `um.Set()` or `im.Set()`.

### Changed

- Aliases configuration for code generation no longer has a top level `table` key
- When configuring relationships, `from_unique`, `to_unique`, `key_nullable` can no longer be configured. They are now inferred from the database.
- When configuring relationships, `to_key` has been changed to `modify` and should be set to `from`, `to` or `""` to indicate which side of the relationship to modify.
  If left empty, Bob will try to guess which side to modify based on the presence of primary keys and unique columns.
- `RelWhere.Value` is now `RelWhere.SQLValue`
- Change CONFLICT/DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to use mods instead of a chainable methods.
- Change `um.Set()` to take a list of expressions.
- Rename Setter method from `Insert()` to `InsertMod()` to avoid confusion.

### Fixed

- Fix several issues with generating code for multi-sided relationships
- Fix an issue where loading many-to-many relationships cause no columns to be selected unless specified
- Fix an issue where many-to-many relationships would not be able to use nested loaders

## [v0.22.0] - 2023-08-18

### Added
