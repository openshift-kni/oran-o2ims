# O-RAN O2IMS

This project is an implementation of the O-RAN O2 IMS API on top of
OpenShift and ACM.

Note that at this point this is just experimental and at its very beginnings,
so don't try to use it for anything close to a production environment.

***Note: this README is only for development purposes.***

## Quick Start

### Build binary
``` bash
make binary
```

### Run

#### Metadata server

The metadata server returns information about the supported versions of the
API. It doesn't require any backend, only the O-Cloud identifier. You can start
it wih a command like this:

```
$ ./orna-o2ims start metadata-server \
--log-level=debug \
--log-file=stdout \
--api-listener-address=localhost:8000 \
--cloud-id=123
```

You can send requests with commands like these:

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8000/o2ims-infrastructureInventory/api_versions | jq

$ curl -s http://localhost:8000/o2ims-infrastructureInventory/v1 | jq
```

Inside _VS Code_ use the _Run and Debug_ option with the `start
metadata-server` [configuration](.vscode/launch.json).

#### Deployment manager server

The deployment manager server needs to connect to the non-kubernetes API of the
ACM global hub. If you are already connected to an OpenShift cluster that has
that global hub installed and configured you can obtain the required URL and
token like this:

```
$ export BACKEND_URL=$(
  oc get route -n multicluster-global-hub multicluster-global-hub-manager -o json |
  jq -r '"https://" + .spec.host'
)
$ export BACKEND_TOKEN=$(
  oc create token -n multicluster-global-hub multicluster-global-hub-manager --duration=24h
)
```

The start the deployment manager server with a command like this:

```
$ ./oran-o2ims start deployment-manager-server \
--log-level=debug \
--log-file=stdout \
--api-listener-address=localhost:8001 \
--cloud-id=123 \
--backend-url="${BACKEND_URL}" \
--backend-token="${BACKEND_TOKEN}"
```

Note that by default all the servers listen on `localhost:8000`, so there will
be conflicts if you try to run multiple servers in the same machine. The
`--api-listener-address` option is used to select a port number that isn't in
use.

The `cloud-id` is any string that you want to use as identifier of the O-Cloud instance.

For more information about other command line flags use the `--help` command:

```
$ ./oran-o2ims start deployment-manager-server --help
```

You can send requests with commands like this:

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8001/o2ims-infrastructureInventory/v1/deploymentManagers | jq
```

Inside _VS Code_ use the _Run and Debug_ option with the `start
deployment-manager-server` [configuration](.vscode/launch.json).
